# Vivarium

![vivarium logo](./Vivarium/public/resources/ui/vivarium%20logo.png)

I present Vivarium, a cozy RPG featuring a cute fox as the main character. I love foxes and I think they would be great
for RPGs! Also, I’m very inspired by Spirit of The North game which I’ve played before. Where a fox discovers beautiful
scenery and has to solve puzzles.​ Vivarium is inspired by it, but different; The fox character has the ability to fight and defeat monsters. Like the most common RPGs, there is a quest system, from the characters the Fox finds along his journey. Those quests involve having to fight some sort of bosses and creatures.

- 3D game prototype for ICG course, built with three.js and vite.

# Gameplay

## Current controls

- movement
  - `w` / `s` move the fox forward and backward
  - `a` / `d` rotate the fox left and right
  - `shift` holds sprint

- camera
  - arrow keys rotate and tilt the camera around the fox
  - when the fox rotates with `a` / `d` the camera follows his rotation

# Development log

## Implementation

all dates are in yyyy‑mm‑dd format.

### 2026‑03‑20

- created a `vivarium` project using vite and three.js
- set up `scenemanager` with perspective camera and blue sky background
- added `lightingmanager` with directional light (sun) and ambient light based on `light_config`
- added `terrainmanager` with flat plane and grass texture from `public/resources/ground`
- added a lot of resources that I had previously researched, such as audios, 3D models and drawings/UI made by me
- imported fox model and textures into `playermanager`
- set up `animationmixer` for idle and movement animations
- implemented `inputmanager` for wasd movement and sprint
- implemented third person `cameracontroller`:
  - camera orbits around the player
  - arrow keys adjust camera angle
  - camera follows fox rotation when using `a` and `d`
- cleaned basic styles so the canvas fills the window
